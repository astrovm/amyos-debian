# Calamares luks module configuration override
# Ensure LUKS2 defaults and PBKDF2 (for GRUB compatibility) unless you ship a GRUB with Argon2id support.

# Calamares generally uses cryptsetup defaults, but we can hint generation
# Some distros configure details in partition.conf; luks.conf may be used by luks jobs.

# Specify default cipher and PBKDF for widest compatibility; adjust if your GRUB supports argon2id.
# Note: If using GRUB with Argon2id support you can switch pbkdf: argon2id.

cipher: aes-xts-plain64
